    <p>If I had a Siamese cat, it would be the kind of cat I’d like because of this cool color-changing feature. When the temperature gets cold, its fur would turn black, just like how I enjoy using the cat emoji with similar looks. The change wouldn’t happen instantly, and even when it gets warmer, the black wouldn’t go away easily, which I think is pretty fascinating. I could imagine it being fun to see the cat slowly darken as the weather changes, kind of like my idea of using mouse movements to simulate cold air in a digital setting, making the virtual cat’s fur change as well.</p>
